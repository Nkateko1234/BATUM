# Part 2 Changes to my website
Changes Implemented on my part 2 from part 1
- I have added 5 CSS stylesheets, every page has its own CSS Style
- I have added a black background colour and used a white font
- The links to other pages are now displayed as a straight line instead of the bullet points.
- I have increased the font sizes and added line spacing on the web page to make it easier to read.
- I added more information on my homepage, about us page, and news updates and cantered most of the information.
- Added styles to my header to have a black background, white font colour, and a navigation bar.
- For the images I added round corners instead of sharp corners to bring the image to life.
- For my navigation bar I included a logo and links to other parts of the site, and it can change its style to a blue colour when you hover your mouse over it. The website work well on smaller screens like phones by showing a "hamburger" menu.
- I have added a tagline under my logo.
- For my products page, i added a product gallery class that displays images in two column grids on large screens and switches to a single column on smaller screens for better readability. 
-Each image has a nice hover effect that makes the pictures grow slightly and glow yellow to grab the user’s attention.
- I added a background colour on my footer and cantered the information to make it look nicer.
